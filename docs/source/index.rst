Modelling Earth Systems - Project code documentation
=====================================================

A python reworking of the thermomechanical code developed in the book Numerical Geodynamic Modelling by Taras Gerya [1]_ . It uses a finite difference staggered grid approach to solve the Stoke's, continuity and temperature equations, along with markers for advection.
