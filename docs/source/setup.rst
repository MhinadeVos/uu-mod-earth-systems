Setting up a model
==================

To set up a model, first create a new directory in the models directory, with a name that describes what your model will be.  This directory needs to contain a version of ``setup.py`` and a ``material_properties.txt``.  The ``setup.py`` file contains three functions:

:py:func:`models.lithosphereExtension.setup.initializeModel`

which is used to set boundary conditions and required parameters for a simulation, and

:py:func:`models.lithosphereExtension.setup.initialize_markers`

which is called by ``initializeModel`` and creates and distributes the markers across the simulation domain.  This function is where the initial material properties and temperatures are defined, based on a marker's position.  This ``initializeModel`` instance should be imported by changing the import path in the ``main.py`` script to match the directory path of you newly created model. 

The final function,

:py:func:`models.lithosphereExtension.setup.gridSpacings`

sets up the grid geometry itself.  There are a few implementations of this function already included, the simplest case of a uniform grid is implemented in the ``SimpleStokes`` model.  The ``lithosphereExtension`` model uses a grid with a fixed high resolution area in the upper central region of the domain, with an increasing grid spacing moving outward.  This version also expands over time.  Finally, the ``Subduction`` model sets up a static Swiss Cross grid.

For your own simulation, you can either copy one of these geometries or create your own implementation.  Each version requires certain parameters to be defined in the ``Parameters`` object.

.. note:: The easiest way to create a new setup is to copy an existing one and edit it! 

There should also be a copy of the Parameters object in ``setup.py``.  This defines all the numerical and physical parameters required for your simulation, there is a base set of parameters that are required for any simulation, which are shown in the example implementation.  You can also add further parameters, by copying the Parameters definition to your setup.py and adding extra attributes, remembering to also add their types to the spec_par list.
  
.. note:: This cannot be done by creating a class that inherits from the example as ``jitclass`` does not support inheritance.

Material Properties
-------------------
This text file should contain the required properties for each different material in your model.  Each row should contain the following values in the order they are listed in the table:

for values which are optional, 0 should be entered if they are not required/ in use.  This must be done consistently, for example, all of the plasticity parameters should be zeroed if plasticity is not in use.


Boundary Conditions
-------------------

Velocity
^^^^^^^^

The boundary conditions applied at each wall for velocities are specified in 4 arrays: ``B_top``, ``B_bottom``, ``B_left`` and ``B_right``, where top/bottom refers to the y-direction and left/right the x.  Each contain 4 columns with xnum/ynum elements for the top and bottom / left and right arrays repectively.  The first two columns are the :math:`v_x` conditions and the second two are the :math:`v_y` conditions.  The values in the columns set the values for the i/jth (for the x/y directions respectively) 'ghost node' velocities as:

``vx[0,j] = B_bottom[j,0] + vx[1,j]*B_bottom[j,1]``

and for the :math:`v_y` condition,

``vy[0,j] = B_bottom[j,2] + vy[1,j]*B_bottom[j,3]``

The table below shows how to implement several common boundary conditions in this structure, note that the single row shown is representing the same pattern in all rows of the array:

+------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Boundary condition     | Array structure (showing a single row)       |
+========================+==============================================+
| No slip                | ``[0, 0, 0, 0]``                             |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Free slip              | ``[0, 1, 0, 0]`` for top / bottom,           |
|                        | ``[0, 0, 0, 1]`` for left / right            |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Grid deformation       | ``[0, 1, -v/xsize*ysize, 0]`` for top/bottom |
| spreading in x         | ``[(-/+)v/2, 0, 0, 1]`` for left/right       |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Prescribed inflow      | ``[v, 0, 0, 0]`` for top / bottom,           |
| parallel to boundary   | ``[0, 0, v, 0]`` for left / right            |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------+

Temperature
^^^^^^^^^^^

A similar structure is used for the temperature boundary conditions.  These are again specified in 4 arrays: ``BT_top``,``BT_bottom``, ``BT_left`` and ``BT_right``.  Each array contains two columns that are used to calculate the ghost node temperature as:
``T[0,j] = BT_top[0] + BT_top[1]*T[1,j]``

Some common boundary condition types can be formulated in this structure as:

+------------------------+------------------------+
| Boundary condition     | Array structure        |
|                        | (showing a single row) |
+========================+========================+
| Insulating             | ``[0, 1]``             |
+------------------------+------------------------+
| Prescribed temperature | ``[T, 0]``             |
+------------------------+------------------------+

Internal velocity Boundary
--------------------------
There is also an option to include a 'mobile wall', which is a vertical wall within the simulation domain on which a :math:`x` and/or :math:`y` velocity can be fixed.  The :math:`x` and :math:`y` velocities can be fixed on the same or separate vertical lines.  This is implemented using the ``B_intern`` array, which has the following format:

+-------+-------------------------------+------------+
| index | description                   | value when | 
|       |                               | not in use |
+=======+===============================+============+
| 0     | x index of the wall on        | -1         |
|       | which the x velocity is fixed |            | 
+-------+-------------------------------+------------+
| 1     | min y-index of the wall       | 0          |
+-------+-------------------------------+------------+
| 2     | max y-index of the wall       | 0          |
+-------+-------------------------------+------------+
| 3     | x-velocity on the wall        | 0          |
|       | described by elements 0-2     |            |
+-------+-------------------------------+------------+
| 4     | x index of the wall on        | -1         |
|       | which the y velocity is fixed |            | 
+-------+-------------------------------+------------+
| 5     | min y-index of the wall       | 0          |
+-------+-------------------------------+------------+
| 6     | max y-index of the wall       | 0          |
+-------+-------------------------------+------------+
| 7     | y-velocity on the wall        | 0          |
|       | described by elements 4-6     |            | 
+-------+-------------------------------+------------+ 

A simple example which shows the effect of this internal wall is in ``models/internalVelocityExample``.

Initial Conditions
------------------
The initial conditions for the simulation are set by applying material IDs and temperatures to the markers in :py:func:`models.lithosphereExtension.setup.initialize_markers`.

Within this function, the markers are distributed evenly across the domain with a small random displacement.  The user can then assign them a material type/ID and a temperature based on their position.  For example, in the lithosphere extension model, the different materials are assigned using depth, to give the layers of the crust and upper mantle.
